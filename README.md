# Housing Sales Analysis

## Project 2 Proposal
George Landsly, Jefferson Covey, Rachel Hein, Nicole Norman

For project 2, we will analyze Texas home sales from 2011-2020. Our selected dataset includes the following on a monthly basis: sale count, dollar volume, average price, median price, total listings, and months inventory. Using this data, our group will look to answer the following questions:

- Have home sales increased significantly over the past 5 years?
- Whatâ€™s the most common price range available for purchase?
- How much do home prices decrease as one moves away from Austin county?
- Which nearby county has the highest average home prices?
- Which nearby county has the lowest average home prices? 

During this project, we will use web scraping, HTML, JavaScript, SQL, D3, and Tableau.
